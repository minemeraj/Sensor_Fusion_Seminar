{\bf\Large Abstract} \\ [1em]
The motivation of this paper is to introduce the sensor fusion and its significance in the improvement of object detection and sensing real-time environment. The first chapter of this paper explains the principal concepts, types and commonly used models of sensor fusion\cite{Wilfried2002}. The second chapter describes some real time applications of sensor fusion in the context of self-driving cars. Each application has different methodology. First, We will see the improvement of the perceived environment model for moving object detection and tracking by multiple sensor fusion where only front view point is considered \cite{Chavez_Garcia_2016}. After that we will explore another moving object detection and tracking experiment with sensor fusion where multiple sensors are configured in various view points of the vehicle which provides a very reliable and safety autonomous driving experience for real-world driving environments \cite{Cho_2014}. The next section describes an obstacle detection task which follows a robust sensor fusion-based method\cite{Shinzato_2014}. After that a sensor-independent fusion approach is described which allows effective sensor replacement and determine redundancy by using probabilistic and generic interfaces\cite{Kunz_2015}. This paper is not only limited to demonstrate the positive sides of sensor fusion, but also try to observe the limitations\cite{Wilfried2002}.
